## TODO LIST
- Integrate buttons, data grid, and form for updating role & timer section on Roles & Timers Page
- Inactivity Page & Blacklist Page currently is not removing kicked users from the inactive users collection
- When toggling the Add Users button, only current users in the server and users not already in the blacklist should appear
- Remove commands item menu from hamburger menu and make commands a collapsible menu section
- Add a refresh button on the Inactivity Page
- The inactivity preview on Purge Page shows "last day active" and "days inactive" sections, data needs to be displayed in those columns
- Purge Page currently only clears the in-memory list, not the inactivity database
- The purge history needs to also show the names of the purged users
- Account details page should have Discord settings option to manage the bot
- If you use the /purge command from the Discord chat it works, but bot crashes right after
- Consider removing /setpurge since it's not being used
- Host the bot for 24hr access
